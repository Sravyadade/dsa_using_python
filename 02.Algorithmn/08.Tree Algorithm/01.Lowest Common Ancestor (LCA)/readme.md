**Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree**
Given the root of a Binary Tree with all unique values and two node values n1 and n2, 
the task is to find the lowest common ancestor of the given two nodes. 
The Lowest Common Ancestor (or LCA) is the lowest node in the tree that has both n1 and n2 as descendants.
In other words, the LCA of n1 and n2 is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root.
We may assume that either both n1 and n2 are present in the tree or none of them are present.
